## üí° What Is It?

Phishing Shield is a **Chrome extension** backed by a **Flask-based ML API** that:
- Automatically scans every site you visit
- Warns you instantly if a site seems like a phishing attempt
- Gives you a confidence score so *you* stay in control

It‚Äôs like a mini security analyst watching your back üëÄ

## üîç How It Works

Behind the scenes:

1. We use **XGBoost** and **TF-IDF** to understand and classify URLs.
2. If a site looks suspicious, we inject a clean warning screen.
3. You‚Äôll see a **confidence level** and can choose to stay or leave.
4. Everything is handled smoothly in the background ‚Äî no friction.
